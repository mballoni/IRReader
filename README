 Project based on the Sparkfun IR lib:

 https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote

 For a better instalation change the library folder name to 'IRRemote' (without quotes).

 The schematic located at the resources folder only fit for the model used for this prototype. Any other IR sensor must use it's own specification.
